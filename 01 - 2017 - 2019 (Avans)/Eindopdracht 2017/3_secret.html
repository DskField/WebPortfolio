					Magikarp is a medium-sized fish Pokemon with large, heavy reddish-orange scales. It has large, 
					vacant eyes and pink lips. Its pectoral and tail fins are white, but it has a stiff, three-peaked fin 
					on its back and stomach that are both yellow. It also has long barbels. The barbels are white on a female 
					and tan on a male.
					A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap 
					high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive 
					in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because 
					of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle it will do nothing but flop around. 
					It is not a strong swimmer, and currents in the water will sweep it downstream. 
					It is normally seen using its former signature move, Splash, to leap out of the water, 
					which makes them easy targets to predators such as Pidgeotto. It is believed that the 
					ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led 
					scientists to research this species. Magikarp is found in many bodies of water, such 
					as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability it usually lives 
					downstream of the water's flow.

					Nintendo DS often shortened to NDS and DS (short for "Developers' 
					System" or "Dual Screen"), is a Nintendo handheld video game system. The Nintendo DS features 
					a clamshell design, similar to the dual screen Game & Watch games and the Game Boy Advance SP. 
					The handheld is noted for having two screens, the lower one being a touch screen. In addition 
					to the touch screen functionality, the DS also includes a built in microphone and, a first for 
					a Nintendo handheld, wi-fi capabilities. A stylus comes packaged with every Nintendo DS system 
					that can be placed into a slot when not in use. Four iterations of the Nintendo DS have been 
					released including the original piece of hardware, the Nintendo DS Lite, the Nintendo DSi, and 
					the Nintendo DSi XL. The successor to the Nintendo DS line is the Nintendo 3DS, a handheld similar 
					in appearance that can produce 3D graphics without the need for glasses.

						Gyarados is a serpentine Chinese dragon-like Pokemon. It is mostly blue, with a yellow 
						underbelly and yellow spots along its body. It has a three-pointed, dark blue crest on 
						its head and four white, dorsal fins. Its mouth is very large and gaping, bearing four 
						canine teeth. It has one barbel on each side of its face. The barbels are white on a female 
						and the same color as the main body on a male. Gyarados's tailfin is similar in structure to 
						the crest on its head, except with a thin, white fin spread between the points.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mega Gyarados is bulkier than its previous form. The fins on its face, its barbels, and its 
						crest are now considerably longer. A large spike extends downward underneath its chin, and it 
						now has a black underside. The yellow spots along its body are replaced by raised red scales 
						that run down its side with a single red stripe below them. Two large white fins appear on its 
						back, similar to those on its face. Most of the other fins along its back disappear, except for 
						the one near the tail. Instead, it now has four white, pointed fins near is tail: two on its back 
						and two on its underside.
